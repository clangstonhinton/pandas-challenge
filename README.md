# pandas-challenge
Employ pandas to analyze data of school academic performance across various KPIs

## Background

Pandas were used to transform school performance data for 15 schools across 30,000+ students, analyze the data and produce summaries of the results.

## Approach

 - Read in two csv files and merged into one dataframe
 - Called pandas functions to perform various calculations such as mean, count, sum and unique.
 - Used groupby to organize the data by school name, grade levels
 - Used .loc to select data based on conditional parameters
 - Used .sort_values to organize data by Top Performing Schools and Bottom Performing Schools
 - Used bins to organize the school performance data by size of school and school spending/student
 - Created summary dataframes to collect data for analysis for the following:
      - District Summary: Total Number of Schools, Total Budget, Avg Math and Reading Scores and % of Students Passing Math, Reading and Overall
      - School Summary:  By school KPIs for School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Avg Math and Reading Scores and % of Students Passing Math, Reading and Overall
      - Math Scores and Reading Scores by School by Grade
      - Academic Scores by School Spending per Student
      - Academic Scores by School Size
      - Academic Scores of Charter vs District Schools
